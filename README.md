# Project Aitakutte

Intended for gaming couples in a long-distance relationship, where:
- not both partners have the same gaming system, or
- not both partners have an online subscription (e.g. Nintendo Switch Online, PlayStation Network) for remote multiplayer

Some code borrowed from:

- asottile's [Arduino Nintendo Switch Controller](https://github.com/asottile/nintendo-microcontrollers)
